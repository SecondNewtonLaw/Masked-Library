# Reason for this to exist

I, sometimes, require some funny 'code', which I use stupidly frequently, due to this, I feel obligated to re-write it all the time and copy paste it,
so, to avoid this, I'll use the power of Git Submodules to my favour (Although NuGet exists).

This repo just holds code I might or might not use when I code.
